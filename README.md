# ESS_python
Evolutionary stable strategy implementation in python.
Basic visualization of a simulated enviroment with two possible strategies: Hawk and Dove.
The goal of the visualization is to see which of the strategies would be stable over iterations. It also displays the sum of the "score" obtained by the Hawks and the Doves.
For each positive interaction of an individual (meaning it wins an encounter with another individual), its point will be displayed in green colour.
