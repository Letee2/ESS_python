# ESS_python
Evolutionary stable strategy implementation in python.

Basic visualization of a simulated enviroment with two possible strategies: Hawk and Dove.
The goal of the project is to see which of the strategies would be stable over iterations. It  displays the sum of the "score" obtained by the Hawks and the Doves,therefore displaying which of them would result more effective.

For each positive interaction of an individual (meaning it wins an encounter with another individual), its point will be displayed in green colour, which initially can be red(Hawk) or blue(Dove).

Note that the animation may not result completely necessary for the purpose of this project, but I thought it would be interesting to visualize it.
